# Horse Animation – Motion Study

A hand-crafted silhouette animation created using Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects. This project focused on motion clarity, rhythmic timing, and seamless looping techniques.

## Tools & Workflow
- **Photoshop:** Hand-drawn horse, rider, and background assets; frame sketches and refinement  
- **Illustrator:** Vector cleanup, proportion control, and silhouette polishing  
- **After Effects:** Rigging, timing adjustments, motion sequencing, and loop construction  

## Technical Focus
- Silhouette readability and pose clarity  
- Modular component rigging for smoother leg and body motion  
- Seamless background loop created from hand-drawn repeating tiles  
- Controlled pacing to maintain consistent stride rhythm
